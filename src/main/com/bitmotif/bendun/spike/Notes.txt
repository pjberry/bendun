Want to kick it off, then say "add this to watch list"
Every 5 minutes (parameterize for testing) go through watch list and find changes

WatchList:
If File, handle as degenerate case

If Directory go through all subdirs and find if any dirs have changed
the creation of a file or dir needs to be noted

Must be able to add and subtract from watchlist
each entry in watch list associated with a string describing task
dump gives start time, end time, total time for description.


for any description, take the earliest time for the entries and the latest time for
the entries to calculate deltas

bendun -start
bendun -add "Description" fileName
bendun -remove "Description" fileName
bendun -dump
bendun -end (will do a dump first)
